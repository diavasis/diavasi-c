`diavasi_consume` is a thin client of `diavasi.data.v1` on the gRPC C stack. It opens a TLS stream, sends the bearer token, Hello version 1, then JoinGroup, and acks each batch. The caller stores no cursor and does not dedupe on `record_id`. A dropped stream is how unacked batches return. Reconnect with the same consumer id and the server replays them.

`proto/data.proto` in this repository is the copy of `diavasi.data.v1` from [github.com/diavasis/diavasi](https://github.com/diavasis/diavasi) tag `v0.12.0`. There is no package registry. Version 0.1.0 is the git tag `v0.1.0` of this repository. Zig calls this library from [diavasi-zig](https://github.com/diavasis/diavasi-zig).

## Install

`libgrpc` and `pkg-config` must be installed. `make` builds `diavasi_consume`.

## Library

```c
#include "diavasi.h"

static void on_record(uint64_t batch_id, uint64_t record_id,
                      const uint8_t *payload, size_t payload_len, void *user) {
    (void)payload;
    (void)user;
    printf("batch %llu record %llu (%zu bytes)\n",
           (unsigned long long)batch_id,
           (unsigned long long)record_id,
           payload_len);
}

diavasi_options options = {
    .addr = "127.0.0.1:7710",
    .ca_path = "/tmp/diavasi-sdk/dataplane-ca.crt",
    .token = "sdk-demo",
    .group_id = "demo",
    .consumer_id = "c",
    .max_in_flight = 1,
    .expect_records = 8,
    .on_record = on_record,
};
diavasi_report report;
char error[256] = {0};
int rc = diavasi_consume(&options, &report, error, sizeof error);
if (rc >= 1 && rc <= 8) {
    fprintf(stderr, "protocol %d: %s\n", rc, error);
} else if (rc != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", error);
}
diavasi_report_free(&report);
```

`on_record` runs before the batch is acked. `payload` is valid only for that call. `max_in_flight` defaults to 1 when left 0. `halt_after_acks` closes after that many acks and does not send Leave. `expect_records` sends Leave once that many records are acked.

Return 0 on success. Protocol codes 1 through 8 are returned as that integer: bad version, bad state, unknown ack, duplicate ack, group not running, unsupported, internal, heartbeat timeout. Any other failure returns -1. `error` receives the message. A bad token sets `grpc UNAUTHENTICATED: unauthorized`. A group that is not running sets `protocol error 5`.

## Run

Start the server from the repo root:

```bash
cargo build -p diavasi-cli
export PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH"
mkdir -p /tmp/diavasi-sdk
diavasi serve --bind 127.0.0.1:7700 --data-bind 127.0.0.1:7710 \
  --store /tmp/diavasi-sdk/state --token sdk-demo
```

In a second terminal, from the repo root:

```bash
curl -fsS -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer sdk-demo" \
  http://127.0.0.1:7700/v1/groups/demo || true
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer sdk-demo" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"group_id":"demo","total_records":8,"payload_size":8,"max_buffer_records":64,"max_buffer_bytes":65536,"batch_max_records":4,"batch_timeout_ms":200,"ordering_contract":"synthetic-u64"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:7700/v1/groups
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer sdk-demo" \
  http://127.0.0.1:7700/v1/groups/demo/start

make process
./process
```

`examples/process.c` is that program. `make` also builds `./diavasi_consume`, the flag client used by the compatibility suite:

```bash
./diavasi_consume --addr 127.0.0.1:7710 --ca /tmp/diavasi-sdk/dataplane-ca.crt \
  --token sdk-demo --group demo --consumer c --total 8
```

Flags: `--addr`, `--ca`, `--token`, `--group`, `--consumer`, `--total`, `--max-in-flight` (default 1), `--halt-after`. The last occurrence of a flag wins. The program prints `record_ids` and `batch_ids`.

## Test

`make test-proto` checks the frame codec and does not need a server or libgrpc. `make test` also builds the gRPC program when `pkg-config` can see `grpc`. That program exits 0 until `DIAVASI_DATA_ADDR`, `DIAVASI_CA`, and `DIAVASI_API_TOKEN` are set.
